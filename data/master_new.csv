The case was set into motion during the fall of 2012, when a 40th Precinct detective says a confidential informant bought heroin from the Melrose Houses apartment on two occasions.

The tenant, Luis Rivera, was arrested along with two other men who were living with him at the time, Darryl Mooney and Edward Hardgrave. Five months later, as the three menês cases were still pending in criminal court, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order forbidding anyone from entering the case is resolved. Rivera says in an affidavit, filed through his attorney, that when cops served him with the lawsuit and closing order, he was arrested and taken to the local precinct station house, then released shortly thereafter. –My understanding was that I could go back to my apartment because I was given my keys. I was handed some papers but I am not able to read or understand them on my own,” says Rivera, who was described by people who knew him as having significant mental and physical impairments. –The next day Ä while I had several people over from the community inquiring about my •arrestê Ä the police came in again, arrested me and took me out of the apartment.” At the time, he says he was on the wait list for a liver transplant and needed help walking.

Two months later, even though Gambrell was locked away in prison, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against Jacksonês apartment and were able to get a temporary closing order, arguing ""upon information and belief the subject premises remains open and the illegal activity contines."" Jackson said 15 cops came to serve her with the papers. –They said since youêre 61 and very cooperative weêre not going to put you out.” Representing herself in court, Jackson agreed on her son would not be allowed in her home for three years and that the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches during that time to ensure she was sticking to the agreement. She said she felt ""coerced"" to sign and never went before a judge. –They said everything was going to be alright,” she said, referring to the NYPD's attorneys. Unbeknownst to her at the time, court documents show that six days earlier the district attorney had sent a letter to the building landlord WHGA instructing the company to file an eviction proceeding against her in Housing Court.

But the mother-of-three ended up back on the streets after she lost the apartment in a nuisance abatement action. Queens Narcotics detectives say a confidential informant bought crack –in the vicinity” of the building three times in May 2012, according to court documents filed by the NYPD. When they searched her apartment, they found five plastic twists of crack, 21 hydrocodone pills, 93 diazepam pills, 4 isosorbide dinitrate pills, 128 ziplock bags, and two .380 caliber cartridges. Police arrested Short and Jonathan Donaldson. Short said the drugs were all on Donaldson, who had come over to use the shower. According to the Queens District Attorneyês Office, Donaldson pleaded guilty a few months later to felony drug sale and possession charges and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Shortês case was dismissed and sealed. But the fallout over the raid continued. That January, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order that put her out on the streets that night. When she showed up to court, she said the NYPDês attorney, who was standing out in the hallway with her landlord, told her the only way she would be able to get back in her apartment ã where her cat was locked inside ã was if she agreed to move out. –They was like, •We're not going to let you in for the cat. We're not going to let you in for clothes. We're going to let you in when you sign this agreement, stating that two months and you're going to get all your stuff out of there.ê” It took four months to settle the case, but eventually Short agreed, without a lawyer, to give up her lease. She said her cat died of starvation in the meantime. Now she sleeps on couches and subways, and said her children are at a homeless shelter with their father. Her neighbor, Marychel Mendez, said sheês grateful Short and her family are gone. –For my ma, it was so scary because sometimes there were people sitting there,” Mendez said, gesturing toward a set of steps that led to their shared landing. –Or sometimes there were drugs right on the floor. So you know, my ma has to clean because we have two ã my little sisters ã so we have to care about that.” Mendez said a strange smell, like –Clorox,” would emanate from the apartment. –Every morning, at night, all day, it was the smell,” Mendez said. So her mother complained to the landlord and the police. Her mother even let detectives use her peephole to photograph the people who passed through Shortês apartment. After the raid, Short was gone and the problems stopped. No more drugs scattered in the hallway, no more addicts on the steps.

When cops raided the apartment, they say they found cocaine, six crack pipes, and other drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue. Thirteen people were arrested, including tenant Anthony Kuforiji, according to court documents filed by the NYPD. A cavity search of one of the individuals at Richmond University Hospital led to the recovery of forty Ziploc bags and one large twist bag of cocaine, filings say. Four months after the raid, on May 2, 2013, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Kuforiji was summonsed to court five days later but failed to appear, and a default judgment was entered against him that took away his rights to the apartment. In an affidavit signed the following day, Kuforiji said he was 70-years-old and disabled. He said he was approached by people who needed a place to rest, and because of his Evangelical Christian religious beliefs, he felt –obligated” to offer them his home. Since the apartment was shut down, Kuforiji said he was homeless and sleeping on the subway. –I am desperate to get into my apartment,” he said. In an affidavit filed in response, the buildingês landlord Daniel Bagliore said Kuforiji was –the worst tenant” in the entire building. The landlord said Kuforiji was arrested three times for drug possession in the last eight months and accuses him of running an illegal boarding house, with guests who have stolen from the buildingês storage closets, offered prostitution services to other tenants, sold drugs, and brought violent fights into the hallways. Bagliore says the police have been called to the building 20 times since Kuforiji moved in and he is a –menace to his fellow tenants.” The judge in the nuisance abatement case, Charles M. Troia, did not overturn his default judgment. Kuforijiês criminal case stemming from the raid mentioned in nuisance abatement filings was ultimately dismissed and sealed, according to the Staten Island District Attorneyês Office. As for the other people arrested, one person was convicted of felony drug possession and sentenced to four years in prison, seven people were convicted of misdemeanor attempted possession of a controlled substance, and four people pleaded to disorderly conduct violations.","240 PARK HILL AVENUE, #LU, STATEN ISLAND, NY","Grymes Hill, Clifton, Fox Hills",40.613029,-74.082367,No,Yes,No,Narcotics,Sealed,Sealed,Sealed,Not convicted,1/9/13,9/25/13,5/2/13,5/7/13,,
