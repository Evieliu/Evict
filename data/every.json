      "blurb":"A sick man was thrown into the streets for nearly a month after he was served with a temporary closing order in a nuisance abatement action. The case was set into motion during the fall of 2012, when a 40th Precinct detective says a confidential informant bought heroin from the Melrose Houses apartment on two occasions. When cops searched the apartment, they say they found seven small plastic envelopes of white powder, one marijuana cigarette and two gravity knives. The tenant, Luis Rivera, was arrested along with two other men who were living with him at the time, Darryl Mooney and Edward Hardgrave. Five months later, as the three men\ufffds cases were still pending in criminal court, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order forbidding anyone from entering the case is resolved. Rivera says in an affidavit, filed through his attorney, that when cops served him with the lawsuit and closing order, he was arrested and taken to the local precinct station house, then released shortly thereafter. \ufffdMy understanding was that I could go back to my apartment because I was given my keys. I was handed some papers but I am not able to read or understand them on my own,\ufffd says Rivera, who was described by people who knew him as having significant mental and physical impairments. \ufffdThe next day \ufffd while I had several people over from the community inquiring about my \ufffdarrest\ufffd \ufffd the police came in again, arrested me and took me out of the apartment.\ufffd At the time, he says he was on the wait list for a liver transplant and needed help walking. A friend who let him sleep on a chair in her studio apartment said it was obvious he was too sick for the streets. \ufffdHe would shit on himself and everything,\ufffd she said. Rivera managed to get an attorney, Runa Rajagopal. \ufffdShe explained that the police got an order from a Civil Court to close me out of my apartment based on the allegation I am a \ufffdpublic nuisance\ufffd and that I am being charged with trespass because of that order. I am still very confused as to how or why the police were able to evict me from my home without a hearing or trial,\ufffd Rivera says. Nearly a month later, Rivera finally reached a settlement with police he was allowed to reenter his home. He agreed that for the next six months, only he would live in the apartment, and that the only people who would be allowed inside are two women who were helping with his care and \ufffdbona fide home health care aids, caseworkers, social workers or other medical\/ clinical\/ and\/or licensed personnel.\ufffd The criminal cases against him and his two friends were all dismissed a few months later, according to a court clerk. Rivera\ufffds sister, Maritza Rivera, said he died last September of cancer to his esophagus, which had spread to other parts of his body, and cirrhosis of the liver.",

The case was set into motion following an investigation by Sgt. Herminio Baez of the 48th Precinct. Baez says in an affidavit that a confidential informant bought a small amount of what he determined to be cocaine from the co-op apartment twice in January of 2013. Baez says when his team raided the apartment that month they found 10 film strips of suboxones, an opiode medication used to treat addiction that comes in the form of a film strip so it can\ufffdt be injected or snorted. \ufffdThose were my brothers,\ufffd said Gomez. \ufffdHe\ufffds got a dope habit. So they found it in his wallet, and since they didn\ufffdt find nothing in the apartment, they put all that on us. They put two on me, two on my cousin, two on my dad, you know?\ufffd Otero, who is 75 and has a scar down her chest from an open-heart surgery, said she was taken to the precinct stationhouse along with the rest of the family \ufffd an experience that still brings tears to her eyes. The Bronx District Attorney said her son David Sanchez pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and was sentenced to a conditional discharge. Felipe Casanova, his cousin who lived upstairs, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and was sentenced to a maximum of 30 days in jail. Gomez and another woman both had their cases dismissed and sealed. More than five months after the arrests, several officers showed up at Otero\ufffds doorstep and served her with the nuisance abatement case that threatened to close the apartment down for a year because it was being used to traffic drugs. Otero said she made her way alone to Bronx Civil Supreme Court alone two days later, where she said she was led into the hallway by a man whose role she was unsure of. \ufffdThey didn\ufffdt talk Spanish. They were just pressuring me to sign. I didn\ufffdt want to sign, but I did because they were insisting. So I signed because I didn\ufffdt want to go to prison for nothing. I thought that if I didn\ufffdt sign it I would go to prison,\ufffd Otero said in Spanish. The settlement said only Otero and Gomez could enter the apartment for the next six months; that any violation will result in the \ufffdimmediate surrender\ufffd of the lease; and that the NYPD could make unannounced inspections for the next year.  Gomez said when the cops showed up afterward to explain the terms, he was so furious he threw a copy of their keys at them, and they never came back. \ufffdIt\ufffds like candy from a baby. What\ufffds a baby going to do? She can\ufffdt defend herself,\ufffd Gomez fumed. \ufffdThey took advantage of her, that\ufffds what I see,\ufffd he said. \ufffdThey took all her rights away right there.\ufffd",

Short\ufffds case was dismissed and sealed. But the fallout over the raid continued. That January, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order that put her out on the streets that night. When she showed up to court, she said the NYPD\ufffds attorney, who was standing out in the hallway with her landlord, told her the only way she would be able to get back in her apartment \ufffd where her cat was locked inside \ufffd was if she agreed to move out. \ufffdThey was like, \ufffdWe're not going to let you in for the cat. We're not going to let you in for clothes. We're going to let you in when you sign this agreement, stating that two months and you're going to get all your stuff out of there.\ufffd\ufffd It took four months to settle the case, but eventually Short agreed, without a lawyer, to give up her lease. She said her cat died of starvation in the meantime. Now she sleeps on couches and subways, and said her children are at a homeless shelter with their father. Her neighbor, Marychel Mendez, said she\ufffds grateful Short and her family are gone. \ufffdFor my ma, it was so scary because sometimes there were people sitting there,\ufffd Mendez said, gesturing toward a set of steps that led to their shared landing. \ufffdOr sometimes there were drugs right on the floor. So you know, my ma has to clean because we have two \ufffd my little sisters \ufffd so we have to care about that.\ufffd Mendez said a strange smell, like \ufffdClorox,\ufffd would emanate from the apartment. \ufffdEvery morning, at night, all day, it was the smell,\ufffd Mendez said. So her mother complained to the landlord and the police. Her mother even let detectives use her peephole to photograph the people who passed through Short\ufffds apartment. After the raid, Short was gone and the problems stopped. No more drugs scattered in the hallway, no more addicts on the steps. Mendez said they finally felt safe.",

A building source said the duo made no effort to hide their illegal operation \ufffd addicts were routinely found smoking crack or nodded out in their stairwell leading up to the roof.

Four people were arrested: Blannon pleaded guilty four days later to a felony possession charge and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Barry pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and was sentenced to 10 days behind bars. Gladys Jones pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge and was sentenced to 15 days behind bars. There is no record of a Janet Diaz arrested on that date. That March, the Manhattan District Attorney\ufffds Office ordered the landlord to file a drug holdover case in Housing Court, and in May the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action in Supreme Court.

The following year they were arrested and convicted after Blannon sold crack to Barry just around the corner from their old apartment on 165th Street. And in 2015, Barry was arrested and convicted after he sold crack in the lobby. He told prosectors he was homeless and listed that building as his last address. The building source, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety, said there are no longer addicts in the stairwell, but the two brothers still hang around. \ufffdI actually see them every week, maybe three times, four times a week, on the block.\"\"\"",

Police searched the apartment the following month and say they found a .22 caliber pistol, gun cartridges, a plastic cover, three razor blades, one glass plate and clear plastic Ziploc bags covered with cocaine residue. Robinson was arrested.  He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession that October and was sentenced to up to 90 days in jail, according to the Bronx District Attorney\ufffds Office. In January 2013, the NYPD served the home with a nuisance abatement action. With the help of a Legal Aid lawyer, Skeeter signed a settlement to ban her son from her home for nine months, but he was allowed to visit after 8 p.m. if his help was needed after her home attendant left. She also agreed to warrantless searches. Skeeter said Robinson stayed at his girlfriend\ufffds place during the period he was banned from her home but is now back. ",

Thirteen people were arrested, including tenant Anthony Kuforiji, according to court documents filed by the NYPD. A cavity search of one of the individuals at Richmond University Hospital led to the recovery of forty Ziploc bags and one large twist bag of cocaine, filings say. Four months after the raid, on May 2, 2013, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Kuforiji was summonsed to court five days later but failed to appear, and a default judgment was entered against him that took away his rights to the apartment. In an affidavit signed the following day, Kuforiji said he was 70-years-old and disabled. He said he was approached by people who needed a place to rest, and because of his Evangelical Christian religious beliefs, he felt \ufffdobligated\ufffd to offer them his home.
