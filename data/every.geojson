    "Blurb":"When Julio Figueroa pleaded guilty in May 2013 to a disorderly conduct violation, he agreed to spend two years inside a drug treatment program as part of the deal. Unbeknownst to him, more was coming his way � the following month the NYPD filed a case in civil court that resulted in him being barred from his grandmother�s home, where he was living at the time, for the rest of his life. Sgt. Christopher Pasquale of the 43rd Precinct says in an affidavit that a confidential informant purchased crack from the apartment, inside a dreary building near the Bruckner Expressway where the hallways fill with the strong stench of marijuana, twice in March of 2013. Pasquale�s team raided the apartment the following month and found 32 ziploc bags of crack and seven ziploc bags of marijuana. Figueroa was arrested and faced five years in prison for felony drug possession, but he pleaded down to a violation by agreeing to enter the drug treatment program. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the apartment in civil court on June 20, 2013 � one of three filed that day involving investigations Pasquale conducted in the same building. The next day, family matriarch Georgina Lorenzo, who was 88 at the time, came to court with one of her sons and agreed that Figueroa would be banned from the apartment forever. �He came here to stay with me because everyone was working,� Lorenzo said in Spanish back in the spring of 2014, sitting on a plastic-covered couch surrounded by framed photographs of her 19 kids, 39 grandchildren, 70 great-grandchildren and 15 great-great grandchildren, many dressed in graduation gowns or colorful christening and Quincea�era outfits. �He would take me to the clinic, give me medication, cook for me and everything. I cried for a long time,� she said. Figueroa successfully completed his drug treatment last May. He was unable to be reached, but his aunt said things have improved for him: He got married, has three small children, and is working at a restaurant in Florida, where he lives with his new family in a townhouse. �He had to leave this block to be better,� said the aunt.",

    "Blurb":"Rosa Peccerelli, an elderly woman who lives in an immaculately decorated apartment near Yankee Stadium, had to bar her two sons and grandson from her home for a year after a run-in with Bronx Narcotics detectives. Detective Alfred Santersio says in an affidavit that a confidential informant claimed he or she bought crack from the apartment twice in January of 2013. Based on that information, Santersio�s team raided the apartment and say they found seven ziploc bags of crack, six tin folders of cocaine and one ziploc bag of marijuana. Rosa says she was visiting a dying relative in Guatemala at the time, but her sons Cozmo Sr. and Gino, and grandson Cozmo Jr., were all arrested. �They destroyed my house. I had to put all my furniture in the garbage,\" she said. Six months later a group of NYPD officers served them with papers to temporarily close the apartment, pending a hearing on a nuisance abatement case. �I remember the police taking me the to medicine cabinet with a gun to my head � I�ll never forget that. I thought we were living in another country, a third world country, the way they came in,� said Cozmo Sr., a chef, of being led by an officer to gather his insulin. Representing herself, Rosa went to court two days later and, fearful she would lose the apartment, agreed to bar her three family members for a year. Rosa said she was terrified to live alone because of health problems. �Many times I�ve fallen in the street,� she added. About two weeks later, on July 26, 2013, the charges against all three men were dismissed, according to the Bronx District Attorney�s Office. But the fallout continued. Cosmo Sr. said he slept on stoops and subways for about a month, washing up in McDonald�s bathrooms, before finding a room in New Jersey. The two others found roommates. �She would bring me sandwiches outside, bring me coffee. I could see it in her eyes � my mom would just shake and cry when she saw me like that,� said Cosmo Sr. In May 2014, an attorney with the Bronx Defenders was able to get the exclusion of Cozmo Sr. and Gino lifted.\n",

The young men were 19 and 21 at the time. Seven people were hauled off to in handcuffs (Diaz explained that they had a family BBQ the night before and a few people had slept over). Charges against everyone were dismissed except Garcia, who pleaded guilty to possession on July 23, 2013 in exchange for a one-year sentence concurrent with another case, according to the Bronx District Attorney�s Office. But that September, the NYPD still moved to close down the apartment for a year. The judge signed a temporary closing order allowing the police to padlock the apartment pending the first hearing on the matter, but Diaz said the cops relented when they saw his infant daughter. He came to court two days later, where he was greeted by a friendly lawyer, who he took to be appointed to him by the court, not realizing he wasn�t entitled to one. �He led me in the hallway and I was telling him I really don�t want to agree to this,� said Diaz of the stipulation, which said if four of his family members and a girlfriend were ever caught inside his home again, it would be shut down for a year. �Basically he was like, giving me advice, like this is what I should do � He said I could try to fight it but I�m risking losing the whole apartment, and he said, �With your daughter and everything, that�s a big risk.� And I was like, �You know what, you�re right.� So I just agreed to it.� Odenthal, then a student at Monroe College, had lived at the house since he was a baby and was on the lease. But the NYPD lawyer said it didn�t matter that Odenthal�s case was dismissed � he was forced to pack his bags and stay at friends� houses until he could find a steady place. Now Diaz says cops regularly peer into his windows as they patrol the long open-air hallway outside his apartment, where children like to play tag. �It doesn�t feel right. It�s wrong,� he said.",

    "Blurb":"Brooklyn dad Ismaelito Villalona was kicked out of his childhood home and separated from his daughter after being arrested for a misdemeanor gambling offense in the summer of 2013 that was ultimately dismissed. Brooklyn Vice detective John Fernandez said in an affidavit that a confidential informant placed a $10 bet inside the apartment, on the first floor of a brick building in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, three times in June 2013. When Fernandez�s squad raided the apartment the morning after the third undercover operation, he said they found gambling records and paraphernalia. Villalona, his sister and their 60-year-old mother were all arrested. A Brooklyn Criminal Court clerk said the case was sealed. Four months after the arrest, the NYPD showed up to serve the family with papers in a civil nuisance abatement case. �They came with a stack of stickers. They said for us to stay and not get evicted, he had to leave,� said sister Yuderca Villalona. Afraid they�d all be left homeless, their mother agreed to bar him from the apartment between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. The police wanted him completely barred. �I do remember fighting for this guy to make sure he had access to his daughter� said the family�s attorney Hernandez Rhau. Ismaelito moved to his uncle�s house nearby, and his daughter, 8 years old at the time, began sharing a bed with her cousin because she was scared to be alone at night. Yuderca admitted her brother had a gambling home, but said he's a good man and the family relies on him. �My mother�s worried. He�s the man of the house. My father died when we were young. He�s our protection. Now there�s only females in the house,� said Yuderca.",

Brooklyn South Narcotics detective Noel Lawrence says in an affidavit that he watched a confidential informant go inside the building and return with $10 worth of crack three times in the Fall of 2013. When the narcotics squad raided the apartment at 5:30 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2013, they say they found a small amount of crack, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Duane Battis, who had previous convictions for weapons and drugs, was arrested. The case was sealed, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney�s Office. Five months after the raid, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Duane's mother, Petronia Battiste, said she called around for an attorney but couldn't find one. \"Nobody wanted to take the case. I didn't have money to pay them.\" Petronia, who has had two stents put in her heart, said she didn�t have the strength to fight, so she agreed Duane would no longer live in the apartment, but he could come between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to assist with her care. �I didn�t have no lawyer. I didn�t have no defense. I didn�t have no say so,� said Petronia, 64. �I wish I had a lawyer to speak more for me. I couldn't keep going there because the week after that I went into the hospital. I was feeling a heaviness on my chest.\" Duane, who is on disability for depression, said back in January that he's living with his girlfriend in Brooklyn. �It�s hard because I�ve got to come here and take a shower, and leave,� he said.",

He was busted after Bronx Narcotics detectives sent a confidential informant to buy $20 worth of crack from him on three separate occasions. When the squad raided the apartment in February of 2013, they found Petillo asleep in his bed with 87 pink ecstasy pills near his head and 30 twists of crack rocks under his body.  Mickey pleaded guilty that September to felony drug possession and was sentenced to five years of probation. The following month, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment in civil court and got a temporary closing order to shut the place down pending a hearing on the matter. �As soon as he got his probation, here they come to lock us out of the apartment,� said his 74-year-old mother Barbara Petillo. �They put a big orange sticker on the door � humiliating.� Barbara said several attorneys turned down her case, saying she couldn�t win, until she found one from the Cardozo Housing Rights Clinic. They agreed Mickey, who has a massive hernia growth visible through his pants, would be banned from the apartment for the entire duration of his probation, and that the police could search her apartment at any time. Barbara said the police have made good on that promise. �I tell them, �Come in � he hasn�t been here.�� Mickey said he was homeless and couch-surfing for a while, until he got on welfare and found a room. �I understand I should be punished � and I think I�m being punished by the five years� probation they gave me. I don�t think they should make people practically homeless,� Mickey said. His mother also faced a separate eviction case in Housing Court through the District Attorney�s Narcotics Eviction Program, but it was dismissed in light of the NYPD agreement. After Barbara fell ill, her attorney was able to get the rules revised so Mickey could visit three times a week. �He has five years � so 2018 � and I may not even be here,� Barbara said, referring to when the prohibition against her son would be lifted.",

Police say a confidential informant bought $20 worth of crack from the apartment four times before they executed a search warrant on March 20, 2013. They found a sandwich bag filled with cocaine, two sandwich bags of heroin, 298 Ziploc bags of crack, one crack rock, a marijuana cigar and drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue. Gambrell, who was on probation for another drug case when he was arrested, pleaded guilty that October and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Two months later, even though Gambrell was locked away in prison, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against Jackson�s apartment and were able to get a temporary closing order, arguing \"upon information and belief the subject premises remains open and the illegal activity contines.\" Jackson said 15 cops came to serve her with the papers. �They said since you�re 61 and very cooperative we�re not going to put you out.� Representing herself in court, Jackson agreed on Dec. 9, 2013 that her son would not be allowed in her home for three years and that the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches during that time to ensure she was sticking to the agreement. She said she felt \"coerced\" to sign and never went before a judge. �They said everything was going to be alright,� she said, referring to the NYPD's attorneys. Unbeknownst to her at the time, court documents show that six days earlier the district attorney had sent a letter to the building landlord WHGA instructing the company to file an eviction proceeding against her in Housing Court. Jackson was served those papers on Dec. 26, 2013. �I signed it and they still turned around and tried to evict me,� she said, not understanding that the NYPD and the District Attorney's Office are two separate entities. Jackson was able to beat the second case, but when Gambrell is released Sept. 2015 he's going to have to find somewhere else to live. �That�s gonna hurt my heart,� she said. �Even though he�s in prison, people commit murder and once they do their time they go back home to mama. He said, 'This is inhumane. I haven�t killed anybody. I haven�t robbed anybody.� He can never come back. How can you do something like that? I shouldn�t have signed it.�",

The police swarmed in the door, cuffed people. I didn�t know what was going on,� Zephyrine said. �They ripped the wall down. They ripped the ceiling down. They busted holes in the wall. They emptied drawers. Then they walked out of here and never said, �Look at the drugs we found, look at the money we found.�� Cops say they found two bags of marijuana, a scale with coke residue, and other paraphernalia with a �yellow residue.� The charges against Kerwyn, who records show had one prior conviction for pot possession, were dismissed and sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against Zephyrine that September detailing the charges. Three days later, Zephyrine showed up to court and signed an agreement that her son would be banned from visiting the apartment for a year, and that the NYPD could make warrantless searches during that time, so she could get back inside. Zephyrine didn't have a lawyer when she showed up to court, and the judge was never in the room. She only spoke to the NYPD's lawyer. \"He said, if I sign this paper here now we can go back in the house now.� Zephyrine said she was amazed her son could be evicted over such relatively minor crimes. �What I don�t understand is, they arrested him and by the night time he�s out. If it�s serious stuff, why are you letting him go?� But she admitted it was actually a relief to bar Kerwyn from the house because he had been causing trouble and getting into fights. �It was a relief for me, it was, that�s why I didn�t hesitate to sign, I just signed,\" she said, adding that he's doing better out in Long Island working with his uncle. �When he was in Queens he really wasn�t working.�",

Their apartment, inside a massive brick complex near JFK Airport, was raided after Queens Narcotics detectives say in court filings that an undercover informant was able to buy crack there twice. The narcotics unit stormed the apartment early one morning in April 2013 and say they found one green ziploc bag containing crack, three pipes and a plate with crack residue, and a grinder with marijuana residue. They arrested four people � Juan Vadi, his two daughters and his sister. Vadi immediately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge and was fined $500, according to the Queens District Attorney�s Office. The other three women�s cases were tossed. Vadi insisted he would never sell drugs outside his parents� home, and suspects the informant was a local addict with her own agenda. He said the reason police found so little drugs was because he had recently quit cold turkey. �I stopped. Unfortunately I just didn�t clean up behind myself, that�s all it was. Nobody in the house knew what I was doing.� He thought his mistakes were behind him, until eight months later, when the police served his family with papers saying they would close the apartment down for a year. Instead, he agreed he would never live there again. Although not an official provision in the stipulation, Vadi said he�s allowed to be there for eight hours a day to care for his parents. �I help them get out of the bed, put them in the wheelchair, shave him, stuff like that,� he said. He sleeps at a nearby relative�s house. But it�s not the same as living with them. �When my father goes to the bathroom on himself, I�m the one who cleans it. Now he has to stay like that �till morning time,� said Vadi. �If you do a real bad act � major drugs, guns � I can see them doing this (filing a nuisance abatement case). But for a misdemeanor fine?

Queens Narcotics detective Peter Mallon says in an affidavit that a confidential informant bought alleged heroin from the home, on a dead end street behind an industrial park in Jamaica, twice in 2012. When they raided the home that September, they found 657 glassines of heroin, one bag of crack, 11 bags of marijuana, eight bullets and $2,736. Rice and five other people were hauled off in handcuffs. Her son, Shakeem Powell, took responsibility for everything and was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Everyone else had their charges dismissed. Eight months later the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the home. Rice said the cops were going to close down the house pending the first hearing in the case, but because she had a disabled mother, they relented. She showed up at court five days later and spoke with the NYPD�s attorney in the hallway outside Judge Oren Kitzes courtroom. She asked for an attorney, but said she was told, �There�s no need to have a lawyer, you just sign the paper and leave.� Originally they wanted to bar everyone who was arrested from the home, but Rice said she fought with them over her two teenage daughters. �You just arrested them because they was there and now you want to bar them from their house?� she said she argued. As a compromise, she agreed she would only allow the two young daughters and her ailing mother inside the house for a year � and nobody else � and that the NYPD could conduct random warrantless searches to ensure she was upholding the agreement. �I didn�t even see a judge,� said Rice. When asked if she would have kicked her son out had the NYPD not forced her to do so, Rice said yes. \"But wouldn't have screwed my other daughter, who didn't have nothin' to do with anything.�",

    "Blurb":"Queens mother Sabrina Rice said she was okay with kicking out her heroin-dealing son, but didn�t understand why she had to put her innocent daughter on the streets as well. Queens Narcotics detective Peter Mallon says in an affidavit that a confidential informant bought alleged heroin from the home, on a dead end street behind an industrial park in Jamaica, twice in 2012. When they raided the home that September, they found 657 glassines of heroin, one bag of crack, 11 bags of marijuana, eight bullets and $2,736. Rice and five other people were hauled off in handcuffs. Her son, Shakeem Powell, took responsibility for everything and was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Everyone else had their charges dismissed. Eight months later the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the home. Rice said the cops were going to close down the house pending the first hearing in the case, but because she had a disabled mother, they relented. She showed up at court five days later and spoke with the NYPD�s attorney in the hallway outside Judge Oren Kitzes courtroom. She asked for an attorney, but said she was told, �There�s no need to have a lawyer, you just sign the paper and leave.� Originally they wanted to bar everyone who was arrested from the home, but Rice said she fought with them over her two teenage daughters. �You just arrested them because they was there and now you want to bar them from their house?� she said she argued. As a compromise, she agreed she would only allow the two young daughters and her ailing mother inside the house for a year � and nobody else � and that the NYPD could conduct random warrantless searches to ensure she was upholding the agreement. �I didn�t even see a judge,� said Rice. When asked if she would have kicked her son out had the NYPD not forced her to do so, Rice said yes. \"But wouldn't have screwed my other daughter, who didn't have nothin' to do with anything.�",

The trouble started in January of 2013, when Officer Adam Jangel of the 103rd Precinct says in an affidavit that a confidential informant twice bought crack from a man operating out of the brick and aluminum sided duplex. When police searched the apartment the following month, they say they found 25 plastic envelopes of marijuana, a joint and 81 rounds of ammunition.

The Queens District Attorney confirms the cases were dismissed and sealed. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case three months later, seeking to close the apartment down for a year. Tommie agreed the family would move out in six weeks. They apparently never got around to it because they are still living there (records show the house has been owned by the bank since 2009).

That January, as Bonilla's case was still ongoing, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order.

After the second bet, cops say they raided the apartment and found �numerous gambling records,� the marked $10 bill from the bet, and $2,656 in cash. Raul Perlata, who had no prior convictions on his record in the state, was arrested. On April 9, 2013, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Two days later, representing himself, Perlata agreed he�d vacate by the end of the month. The following July, Perlata pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of gambling records and was fined $250.",

When cops raided the apartment, they say they found four Ziploc bags of crack, two guns and ammunition. Additionally, they say they found 57 Ziploc bags of crack from the courtyard below the bathroom window of the apartment. Four people were arrested, including tenant Crystal Harris and Benjamin Fair. The following month, Fair pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapon possession charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment on May 29, 2014 and was granted a temporary closing order. Tenant Harris appeared without an attorney four days later and the matter was adjourned until June 16, to give her time to find an attorney. Once she had an attorney, she was allowed back in her apartment, but had to agree to prohibit Fair from entering for one year.",

When cops raided the apartment that March, they say they found one bag of crack and $1,098. They arrested Hassan Sillie, who pleaded guilty the next day to misdemeanor drug possession and was sentenced to time-served. Three months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. When tenant Rebecca Wilson appeared in court, the city agreed to let her back inside her apartment as long as she promised to �make every effort to remove Hassan Sillie from the lease,� and to keep him out of the apartment in the meantime. When she returned to court, she agreed he would be excluded for two years, and that the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches of her apartment. She also agreed not to sue the city over the raid or closing of her apartment.",

Cops raided the apartment and say they found a plastic bag of marijuana, a cigar wrapper containing marijuana and a cigar package. Michael Lewis, who has a lengthy rap sheet, and his sister Matalie Lewis were arrested. The Brooklyn District Attorney�s Office said there is no public record of the case, which likely means charges either were not filed or they were dismissed and sealed. Two months after the arrest, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and Matalie, representing herself, agreed Michael would no longer be allowed in the house, and that the city would be indemnified against any claims related to the investigation or the closing of the premises.

When they raided the apartment, they say they found a pipe with crack residue and arrested three people, although only one arrest is included in the exhibits, Catherine Gonzalez. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was given a conditional discharge. Seven months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement proceeding against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Tenant Reginald Murad, who has had multiple arrests but none on the day mentioned in the nuisance abatement complaint, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, agreed he would surrender the lease in two months.",

When they raided the apartment, they say they found marijuana, .22 caliber rounds, multiple daggers and drug paraphernalia. Four people were arrested. Four months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and were granted a temporary closing order. Representing herself, tenant Nicole Brown agreed Anthony Lawes, Abu Northe and Precious Buckman would vacate the apartment immediately, and that the city is idemnified against any claims related to the investigation or closing of the apartment. The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office said there is no public record of a criminal case against Lawes or Beckman, indicating they either weren�t charged or the charges were dismissed and sealed. Northe, who had no prior criminal record, received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal the day he was arrested.",

When they raided the apartment, they say they found 21 Ziplock bags of marijuana weighing less than an eight of an ounce, a digital scale and ammunition. Malik Matthews, who had prior weapons possession convictions, was arrested. Five months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment. His case was pending at the time. Representing herself, Latrice Matthews agreed that her son would not live in the apartment anymore, and �under no circumstances� would stay overnight. A year after the arrest, Malik pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a violation, and was sentenced to three days community service. When asked about the proceeding by the Daily News, Latrice said, �It was unfair. That�s my son. This was his comfort zone.� She said he�s staying with her brother in Queens.",

When cops raided the apartment, they say they found marijuana and cash, arrested George Reeves (aka Enos Benjamin) and charged him with marijuana possession. It appears Reeves was never prosecuted because the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office and the Brooklyn Criminal Court clerk both said they have no record of there ever being a case against him for an arrest on this date. Five months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment. Tenant Marvin Jones agreed Reeves would never return. When The News visited the apartment, a person who answered the door said Reeves was his mother�s friend and never lived there.",

The last two times, they say Anderson met in another adjacent building and bought more oxycodone pills.

When they raided the apartment, they say they found crack, a scale with cocaine residue, two marijuana cigarettes, a bag of marijuana, a box of sandwich bags, ammunition, and $735 in cash. Mary Jones and Shantwone Ellerbe were arrested. Three months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Jones, who records show had no prior record of a conviction in the state of New York, attempted to fight the de-facto eviction by representing herself. In a hand-written filing, she says she�s lived at the apartment since birth, goes to work every day, and has never been in trouble before. She was not successful, and in July agreed she�d move out by Sept. 12, 2013. The same day she was to be out, she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge in her criminal case and was sentenced to a conditional discharge. Ellerbe�s case was tossed for �insufficient evidence to prosecute,� according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.",

When they raided the apartment on Dec. 1, 2012, they say they found 39 Ziploc bags of crack in a drawer in Kenneth Hendy�s bedroom and a plastic bag of marijuana. Hendy was arrested. He pleaded guilty that May to felony drug possession and was sentenced to 20 days of community service and a three-year conditional discharge. Later that month, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Representing herself, Veda Handy agreed that Kenneth would never enter the apartment again, except in an emergency situation.",

That June, cops raided Haywood's apartment and found 310 bags of crack, drug paraphernalia, a pistol and ammunition. Jermaine Haywood was arrested and hit with felony gun and drug charges. In January 2014, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Representing herself, Cynthia Cummings, the grandmother of Haywood's child, agreed he would never be allowed into the apartment again, and that the NYPD could make warrantless searches between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. to ensure she upheld the agreement. In August 2015, Haywood pleaded guilty to felony charges of drug and weapon possession, and was sentenced to five years in prison and five years of post-release supervision for each charge, to be served concurrently, according to the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor.",

Gladys Jones pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge and was sentenced to 15 days behind bars. There is no record of a Janet Diaz arrested on that date. Representing herself, Brenda Craig agreed in May 2013 that her son Barry Craig would be out in two months, but could visit between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Brenda Craig also agreed that Blannon Craig, Jones and Diaz would never step foot inside the apartment again. She also agreed the NYPD could search her apartment up to once a month. ",

    "Blurb":"Queens Narcotics cops used a confidential informant to buy cocaine at the apartment twice in January 2013, the NYPD says in court documents. Then they raided the apartment and say they found 13 bags and a pill bottle with cocaine inside, hundreds of empty Ziploc bags, and four metal strainers. Three people were arrested, including Willie Swain, who already had a lengthy rap sheet. Swain pleaded guilty the next day to a misdemeanor possession charge and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. The other two  had their cases dismissed, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. Five months later, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment and was granted a temporary closing order. Swain and two other tenants, representing themselves, agreed Swain would be out in 45 days and that the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches to ensure they were in compliance. Swain filed a request for more time to vacate in August 2013, claiming his only source of income was public assistance and that he had �no money, and no place to stay.�  When The News visited his house last summer, a relative said he was still living there.",

    "Blurb":"Queens Narcotics detectives say they used a confidential informant to purchase crack from a woman at the Jamaica apartment four times in January and February 2013,  according to NYPD court filings. When cops raided the apartment, they say they found two marijuana cigars, one scale with crack residue, three grinders with marijuana residue, and dozens of small Ziploc bags. Shaquana Wronge, who had at least four prior drug convictions, was arrested. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Nearly five months later, the NYPD got a closing order on the apartment. Representing herself, Wronge agreed to move out in two weeks.",

When they raided the apartment, they say they found two packages of cocaine, drug paraphernalia containing cocaine residue, and one Xanax pill. Six people were arrested. Carmelita Burke, who wasn't arrested that day, had been living in the apartment through the Fortune Society, a group that helps people who have been incarcerated re-enter society. When the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment in March 2014, Burke agreed she would be out by the end of the month.",

    "Blurb":"Queens Narcotics detectives say a confidential informant bought heroin at the apartment at a Far Rockaway housing project twice during February 2014, according to NYPD court documents. When cops raided the apartment, they say they found 14 bags of heroin. Crystal Wilson and Stanley Davis, the father of her son, were arrested. \"They handcuffed my 12-year-old, his friend, who was 14 at the time, everyone at the house was handcuffed,\" said Wilson. The next day, Davis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge and was sentenced to 15 days in jail. Wilson got an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal and her case was sealed in September, she said. Four months after the arrest, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement proceeding against the apartment. She said the cops let her stay inside the house instead of enforcing the temporary closing order because she had small children in the house. When Wilson got to court, she said she requested a lawyer. \"He said, 'There's one that will be calling you.' Come to find out, he was the one that brought the papers the day before,\" referring to the NYPD lawyer who showed up at her house to issue the closing order. \"He said, 'I'm here for you.' The judge never came out.\" Feeling out of options, Wilson said she agreed Davis would be excluded from the apartment for one year. During that time, the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches to ensure she's in compliance. \"It bothered me because we've been together a long time,\" said Wilson. \"We have a 13-year-old son that we raise and it bothers my son. He (the father) can't even come up to the third floor.\" But Wilson says she's still fighting a possible eviction from the New York City Housing Authority over the same arrest. \"There's no place to go but to a shelter, and that's how I got my apartment, is through the shelter, 18 or 19 years ago.\"",

A nuisance abatement complaint was filed against the apartment on May 15, 2015 and Judge Oren Kitzes granted a temporary closing order. The complaint does not mention any searches or arrests of the apartment. But Queens Criminal Court records show that Kejeon Butler, who already had a lengthy rap sheet for drug charges, was arrested after throwing a bag of cocaine out the window during the execution of a criminal court search warrant earlier that morning. Two days later, representing himself, tenant Michael Butler agreed Kejeon Butler would move out and never step foot inside again, and that the NYPD could conduct warrentless searches of the apartment to ensure he was upholding the agreement. In July 2013, Kejeon pleaded guilty to a felony drug possession charge and was sentenced to two years in prison.",

Three people were arrested, including Barbara Hill. Three months later, Hill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That May, the NYPD got a closing order on the home. Representing herself, homeowner Elizabeth Hill agreed to permanently ban Barbara from the home. ",
