Unbeknownst to him, more was coming his way — the following month the NYPD filed a case in civil court that resulted in him being barred from his grandmother’s home, where he was living at the time, for the rest of his life. Sgt. Christopher Pasquale of the 43rd Precinct says in an affidavit that a confidential informant purchased crack from the apartment, inside a dreary building near the Bruckner Expressway where the hallways fill with the strong stench of marijuana, twice in March of 2013. Pasquale’s team raided the apartment the following month and found 32 ziploc bags of crack and seven ziploc bags of marijuana. Figueroa was arrested and faced five years in prison for felony drug possession, but he pleaded down to a violation by agreeing to enter the drug treatment program. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against the apartment in civil court on June 20, 2013 — one of three filed that day involving investigations Pasquale conducted in the same building. The next day, family matriarch Georgina Lorenzo, who was 88 at the time, came to court with one of her sons and agreed that Figueroa would be banned from the apartment forever. “He came here to stay with me because everyone was working,” Lorenzo said in Spanish back in the spring of 2014, sitting on a plastic-covered couch surrounded by framed photographs of her 19 kids, 39 grandchildren, 70 great-grandchildren and 15 great-great grandchildren, many dressed in graduation gowns or colorful christening and Quinceañera outfits. “He would take me to the clinic, give me medication, cook for me and everything. I cried for a long time,” she said. Figueroa successfully completed his drug treatment last May. He was unable to be reached, but his aunt said things have improved for him: He got married, has three small children, and is working at a restaurant in Florida, where he lives with his new family in a townhouse. “He had to leave this block to be better,” said the aunt.","914 Hoe Avenue, The Bronx, NY",Yes,No,Bronx,Julio Figueroa,1/27/78,38,Hispanic,No,Hunts Point,40.82141608,-73.89022283,Narcotics,Disorderly conduct,Violation,Drug treatment,Violation,4/4/13,5/23/13,6/20/13,6/21/13,,38,Bronx2509292013,Y,13543822.jpg,"Cosmo Sr. poses for a portrait in his mother's apartment in the Bronx, New York.",,"Rosa Peccerelli, an elderly woman who lives in an immaculately decorated apartment near Yankee Stadium, had to bar her two sons and grandson from her home for a year after a run-in with Bronx Narcotics detectives.

Ismaelito moved to his uncle’s house nearby, and his daughter, 8 years old at the time, began sharing a bed with her cousin because she was scared to be alone at night.

He was busted after Bronx Narcotics detectives sent a confidential informant to buy $20 worth of crack from him on three separate occasions. When the squad raided the apartment in February of 2013, they found Petillo asleep in his bed with 87 pink ecstasy pills near his head and 30 twists of crack rocks under his body.  Mickey pleaded guilty that September to felony drug possession and was sentenced to five years of probation. The following month, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against the apartment in civil court and got a temporary closing order to shut the place down pending a hearing on the matter. “As soon as he got his probation, here they come to lock us out of the apartment,” said his 74-year-old mother Barbara Petillo. “They put a big orange sticker on the door — humiliating.” Barbara said several attorneys turned down her case, saying she couldn’t win, until she found one from the Cardozo Housing Rights Clinic. They agreed Mickey, who has a massive hernia growth visible through his pants, would be banned from the apartment for the entire duration of his probation, and that the police could search her apartment at any time. Barbara said the police have made good on that promise. “I tell them, ‘Come in — he hasn’t been here.’” Mickey said he was homeless and couch-surfing for a while, until he got on welfare and found a room. “I understand I should be punished — and I think I’m being punished by the five years’ probation they gave me. I don’t think they should make people practically homeless,” Mickey said. His mother also faced a separate eviction case in Housing Court through the District Attorney’s Narcotics Eviction Program, but it was dismissed in light of the NYPD agreement. After Barbara fell ill, her attorney was able to get the rules revised so Mickey could visit three times a week. “He has five years — so 2018 — and I may not even be here,” Barbara said, referring to when the prohibition against her son would be lifted.","2036 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY",Yes,Yes,Manhattan,Mickey Petillo,4/14/76,40,Hispanic,Yes,Washington Heights South,40.8352717,-73.9403493,Narcotics,Drug possession,Felony,Probation,Convicted,2/1/13,9/3/13,10/29/13,11/15/13,,231,Manhattan4521802013,Y,12570553.jpg,"Linda Jackson, 62, inside her apartment at 16-18 Old Broadway.She faces eviction because her son, Quash Gambrell, 36 is convicted of drug charges and in a prison now. Wednesday, April 9th, 2014 Manhattan, New York. ( Michael ,Schwartz/ for New  York Daily News)",,"Linda Jackson, 62, said she was attending her mental health program, where she’s being treated for schizophrenia, when her son Quashi Gambrell was busted for selling crack and heroin out of her Manhattanville apartment. Police say a confidential informant bought $20 worth of crack from the apartment four times before they executed a search warrant on March 20, 2013. They found a sandwich bag filled with cocaine, two sandwich bags of heroin, 298 Ziploc bags of crack, one crack rock, a marijuana cigar and drug paraphernalia with cocaine residue. Gambrell, who was on probation for another drug case when he was arrested, pleaded guilty that October and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Two months later, even though Gambrell was locked away in prison, the NYPD filed a nuisance abatement case against Jackson’s apartment and were able to get a temporary closing order, arguing ""upon information and belief the subject premises remains open and the illegal activity contines."" Jackson said 15 cops came to serve her with the papers. “They said since you’re 61 and very cooperative we’re not going to put you out.” Representing herself in court, Jackson agreed on Dec. 9, 2013 that her son would not be allowed in her home for three years and that the NYPD could conduct warrantless searches during that time to ensure she was sticking to the agreement. She said she felt ""coerced"" to sign and never went before a judge. “They said everything was going to be alright,” she said, referring to the NYPD's attorneys. Unbeknownst to her at the time, court documents show that six days earlier the district attorney had sent a letter to the building landlord WHGA instructing the company to file an eviction proceeding against her in Housing Court. Jackson was served those papers on Dec. 26, 2013. “I signed it and they still turned around and tried to evict me,” she said, not understanding that the NYPD and the District Attorney's Office are two separate entities. Jackson was able to beat the second case, but when Gambrell is released Sept. 2015 he's going to have to find somewhere else to live. “That’s gonna hurt my heart,” she said. “Even though he’s in prison, people commit murder and once they do their time they go back home to mama. He said, 'This is inhumane. I haven’t killed anybody. I haven’t robbed anybody.’ He can never come back. How can you do something like that?

(Christie M Farriella for New York Daily News)",,"Theodate Kerwyn had been living at his mother Agnes Zephyrine’s Jamaica home with his wife and their daughter when Queens Narcotics cops raided the apartment in March 2013. The cops claimed they had witnessed a confidential informant buy coke from the house three times the previous month, according to the NYPD's civil court filings. “Boom! The police swarmed in the door, cuffed people. I didn’t know what was going on,” Zephyrine said. “They ripped the wall down. They ripped the ceiling down. They busted holes in the wall. They emptied drawers. Then they walked out of here and never said, ‘Look at the drugs we found, look at the money we found.’” Cops say they found two bags of marijuana, a scale with coke residue, and other paraphernalia with a “yellow residue.” The charges against Kerwyn, who records show had one prior conviction for pot possession, were dismissed and sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. The NYPD filed a nuisance abatement action against Zephyrine that September detailing the charges. Three days later, Zephyrine showed up to court and signed an agreement that her son would be banned from visiting the apartment for a year, and that the NYPD could make warrantless searches during that time, so she could get back inside. Zephyrine didn't have a lawyer when she showed up to court, and the judge was never in the room. She only spoke to the NYPD's lawyer. ""He said, if I sign this paper here now we can go back in the house now.” Zephyrine said she was amazed her son could be evicted over such relatively minor crimes. “What I don’t understand is, they arrested him and by the night time he’s out. If it’s serious stuff, why are you letting him go?” But she admitted it was actually a relief to bar Kerwyn from the house because he had been causing trouble and getting into fights. “It was a relief for me, it was, that’s why I didn’t hesitate to sign, I just signed,"" she said, adding that he's doing better out in Long Island working with his uncle. “When he was in Queens he really wasn’t working.”","131-20 Mathewson Ct, Jamaica, NY",Yes,Yes,Queens,Theodate Kerwyn,3/10/83,33,Black,No,St. Albans,40.67870378,-73.76156196,Narcotics,Sealed,Sealed,Sealed,Not convicted,3/15/13,Sealed,9/6/13,9/9/13,,264,Queens225422013,Y,,,,"Two ailing parents, both in their 80s, were left without their primary caretaker after their son, a recovering addict, was caught with a bag of crack and drug paraphernalia. Their apartment, inside a massive brick complex near JFK Airport, was raided after Queens Narcotics detectives say in court filings that an undercover informant was able to buy crack there twice. The narcotics unit stormed the apartment early one morning in April 2013 and say they found one green ziploc bag containing crack, three pipes and a plate with crack residue, and a grinder with marijuana residue. They arrested four people — Juan Vadi, his two daughters and his sister. Vadi immediately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge and was fined $500, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office. The other three women’s cases were tossed. Vadi insisted he would never sell drugs outside his parents’ home, and suspects the informant was a local addict with her own agenda. He said the reason police found so little drugs was because he had recently quit cold turkey. “I stopped. Unfortunately I just didn’t clean up behind myself, that’s all it was. Nobody in the house knew what I was doing.” He thought his mistakes were behind him, until eight months later, when the police served his family with papers saying they would close the apartment down for a year. Instead, he agreed he would never live there again. Although not an official provision in the stipulation, Vadi said he’s allowed to be there for eight hours a day to care for his parents. “I help them get out of the bed, put them in the wheelchair, shave him, stuff like that,” he said. He sleeps at a nearby relative’s house. But it’s not the same as living with them. “When my father goes to the bathroom on himself, I’m the one who cleans it. Now he has to stay like that ’till morning time,” said Vadi. “If you do a real bad act — major drugs, guns — I can see them doing this (filing a nuisance abatement case). But for a misdemeanor fine?
